v0.1.0b

**************************
*** Release Highlights ***
**************************

*** Most features of Rising Stars 1.2.0 are included.

*** The global scale of the universe has been increased based on dolynick's outstanding work with DOF.
Movement has been rebalanced to achieve a more realistic feel and, combined with a reduction in population growth and a serious dent in budget due to longer colony ship travel time,
make expansion more system-centric and less of a colony-spam.
Resources and economy have been rebalanced to support these changes in a way that gameplay progression still feels dynamic and rewarding. Some existing buildings and orbitals have been modified, and new ones have been added, to boost economy where needed (including budget). New synergies allow to take advantage of the environment or of the presence of other infrastructure.
This new balance is also designed to make infrastructure building and careful expansion a (hopefully) viable alternative to fast expansion and allow smaller, well developed empires to compete with larger empires with empty systems and planets.

*** The universe has been revised to be closer to current scientific knowledge.

*** The game AI has been improved. It is a work in progress and most of the current improvements are a basis for future features but some of them already have a visible impact.

*** Sensors from ABEM (the ancestor of Rising Stars) have been reimplemented with a completely different approach. All flagship and station hulls now have integrated basic sensors. Sight range is moderate, slightly scaled with size and can be upgraded through research.
Specific sensor subsystems can be added to flagship	and station designs to further enhance sight range but their design is completely different.
Planets and orbitals also have sight range which can also be upgraded through research.
Players always have full vision on their starting systems as if they had fully explored it.

*** This version introduces new weapon exclusive modifications, similar to generic modifiers, allowing to install weapon-specific modifiers granting special effects or changing certain parameters. Weapon modifications are (generally) mutually exclusive.

***********************************************************
*** Differences with / Changes to Rising Stars Features ***
***********************************************************

[*] Game Options

- Added Automatically Claim Spatial Anomalies: When toggled on, spatial anomalies in your tradable area will automatically be claimed into your territory. Toggled off by default.
*** This adds the possibility to activate or deactivate the nebula claiming script created by Dalo Lorn. Thanks to new AI features the impact on AI expansion capabilities will be null in normal game conditions (read: reasonable nebula frequency).

[*] Orbitals

- Subspace Telescope Array has been renamed to Quantum Telescope Array, has no maintenance cost anymore and can no longer move. Its Telescope ability now has a range of 1M units and it now costs an amount of Energy and FTL Energy linearly relative to the target distance.
- The Outpost upgrades have been replaced by new mechanics.
- Outposts can no longer store cargo.
- Star Children Hydroponics Station and Water Reclamation Facility are not included in favor of different mechanics.
- Hydroponics Satellite is the same as vanilla, although its cost was rebalanced.

[*] Planets

- Level 6 planets now require 2 additional Level 1 resources (up from 0).

[*] Research

- The research grid is completely different.
- Rebalanced several nodes.
- Removed the bonus granted to railguns when researching muon projectors in favor of the new weapon modification feature.
- Terraforming technologies are not included, except the basic Terraforming node. Terraforming will have a different destiny in SoI.

[*] Subsystems

- Removed the maintenance cost reduction and shield capacity bonus for Miner Hull. Reduced the cargo storage bonus to balance the introduction of a new type of hull.
- Re-added Muon Cannon and rebalanced it accordingly. Now renamed to Muon Projector.
- Renamed Muon Cannon Battery to Muon Projector Battery.
- Re-added and rebalanced Carpet Bomb.

************************
*** Detailed Changes ***
************************

[*] Artifacts

- Renamed Arcology to Floating City.

[*] Artificial Intelligence

- AIs are now able to build and prioritize outposts to protect their territory or expand beyond systems without planets or resources (including nebulae). Evangelical lifestyles will build star temples instead.
- AIs now expand outside their territory when they are out of other options.
- AIs now build moon bases on planets when needed (excepted, of course, Star Children).
- AIs now slow down or even temporarily stop their colonization effort when necessary in order to maintain a budget buffer for other expenditures.
- Colonization prioritization has been revised and all randomness in the decision process has been removed to be replaced by a deterministic weighting.
- AIs now abandon certain planets if their estimated next budget becomes negative.
- AIs can now choose to focus on one particular area with their budget spending under certain circumstances.
- AIs can now borrow money from their next budget for construction projects critical to their development.
- Fixed a vanilla bug where orbital types present in systems tracked by the AIs were not loaded from a previously saved game.

[*] Attitudes

- Progressive Level 3 effect now grants four times as less research points to compensate for higher FTL Energy amounts spent overall.

[*] Buildings

*** Most new buildings are available to non Ancient and, obviously, non Star Children races only.

- Space Elevators now add 1 Money generation per Planet Level starting from Level 1 if a Starport is present in the system and additionally cost 1k ore and 50 Labor to build.
- Added Mining Complex. Adds an Ore resource that can be exported and generates 10 Ore per minute at its destination. Also adds 2 Labor pressure and increases the pressure given by native Titanium and Native Gold by 1. Unlike the Ancient Strip Miner, Ore stored on the planet is not moved on export. Base and maintenance costs of 190k and 120k, respectively.
- Added Fossil Fuel Facility. Adds 1 Energy and 1 Money pressure and increases the pressure given by native Natural Gas or Oil by 1. Base build and maintenance costs of 110 and 50k, respectively. Also costs 25 Research to build.
- Added Electronics Factory. Can replace a Level 1 resource and adds 3 Money pressure. Consumes 8 ore per minute. Base build and maintenance costs of 40k and 30k, respectively. The building becomes inactive if there is no more Ore left on the planet (which can then potentially level down).
- Added Healthcare Complex. Adds 1 Population and increases Population growth by 10%. Base build and maintenance costs of 85k and 20k, respectively. Also costs 100 Research to build and 100 more for each Healthcare Complex already built or building on the planet. Cannot be built by Mechanoid lifestyles.
- Added Arcology. Adds 5 Population and replaces 5 cities. Costs 2.5M, 2k Ore, 20 Influence, and 75 Labor.
- Added Collector, exclusive to Ancient races: equivalent to a Core for gas giants. Can only be constructed on Rare Gases resources. Produces 100% of the pressure that the planet's native resource gives. Pressure from asteroids imported at this planet is automatically produced.
- Added Harvester, exclusive to Ancient races: equivalent to an Infuser for gas giants. Can only be constructed on Rare Gases resources. Increases the level of this planet by 1. Uses 2 Ore per second and 1 Base Materials per minute.
- Added Simulator, exclusive to Ancient races: replacement for Arcology. Increases the income of a planet by 250k. Costs 2.5M, and 20 Influence. Uses 1 Base Materials per minute.

[*] FTL

*** FTL has been completely rebalanced with several objectives in mind. First: to make long distances matter more, especially in early game. Costs are balanced to make FTL a luxury at first and more common later, as more FTL sources and storage become available, but needs to be carefully planned and managed until very late game. Second: to take into account the possibility to research more FTL methods and even more clearly make
different methods preferable in different situations. Third: To tone down the advantages over sublight, while still retaining a clear advantage.

- Increased hyperdrive speed by a factor of 20. Hyperdrive speed ratio is identical to vanilla to make up for its decreased effectiveness over very long distances. Cost is unchanged, meaning it costs more FTL Energy to get from system A to system B.
- Increased fling beacon range by a factor of 4 and fling cost by a factor of 2. Fling cost is increased to make up for its increasing effectiveness the longer the distance is (travel time is constant, meaning that speed increases with distance). The range of beacons is reduced compared to vanilla.
- Increased slipstream cost by a factor of 1.4, optimal range by a factor of 5 and inaccuracy by a factor of 10. Effects of inaccuracy now start only beyond optimal range. Opening a slipstream to a very distant location will require either a ship-sized generator or a lot of FTL Energy. Opening it around the intended location and not 3 systems away will require a big ship.
- Increased jump drive range by a factor of 10. Jump drive is still the fastest and cheapest, but the safe range is half of vanilla.
- Increased gate maintenance cost to 0.25 FTL/s. More gates are needed to get a good territory coverage, and juggling with gate activation and deactivation is an absolute must.

[*] Game Options

- Added Quick Start: when toggled on, empires will be able to expand to other systems almost immediately instead of having to build a basic economy first. This reverts the now slower game start to more or less vanilla speed. This option is off by default.
- Added Supermassive Black Holes: when toggled on, black holes at the center of galaxies are supermassive and thus much bigger. Much. BIGGER. (And make an equally bigger boom.)
- Reduced the minimum and maximum values of the System Size slider to prevent systems that are too small or too large colliding each other. Added a tooltip warning to deactivate the Supermassive Black Holes option when reducing size (the size of this system is enforced and doesn't play well with reduced sizes).
- Disable Starting Fleets is now on by default.
- Default asteroid and orbital labor cost step increased to 100% (up from 50%).
- Reactivated Legacy Exploration Mode from ABEM (default: off) as sensors are back.

[*] Lifestyles

- Somewhat flattened the Extragalactic free colonizer frequency exponential curve with a nerf hammer. Early game frequency is unchanged.

[*] Orbitals

- Activated and added support for orbital modules, an unfinished / unreleased vanilla feature for orbitals. Modules are add-ons that can be constructed on previously built orbitals. Some orbitals make use of this feature and this will be extended further in a future release.
- Commerce Stations now additionally cost 5 Influence and provide income, for each friendly planet in the system excluding the owner's, equal to 100k per planet Level starting from 1 and up to 300k. Only one Commerce Station may now be built per system.
- Hydroponics Satellite now have an additional 50k maintenance cost, but cost 350 energy instead of 100 research to build.
- Tactical Satellites now have an additional 25k maintenance cost.
- Solar Satellites now have an additional 50k maintenance cost and cost 350 energy (down from 500) to build.
- Added Telescope Array, which has 40% Telescope power of the quantum version. Costs 200k to build, requires no ore but has a 40k maintenance cost. Primarily designed for early scouting, when interstellar travel is a problem, and border control. Its Telescope ability only costs Energy (and no FTL Energy).
- Added Phased Array Laser Drive. Has the 'Toggle Laser Propulsion Beam' ability, a laser transmitting photon momentum to a reflector panel (dubbed lightsail) on a ship and providing thrust. Range of 250k units.
- Added Starport. Allows trade through its system. Provides 30k income for each owned and friendly planet in the system, up to 120k. Build and maintenance costs of 300k and 70k, respectively. Only one Starport may be constructed per system.
- Added Long Haul Docking Bays Starport module. Allows global resource trade. Build and maintenance costs of 300k and 100k, respectively. Also costs 5 Influence to build.
- Added Staging Hub. Allows trade through its system. Can construct mining bases on asteroids. Has no innate labor, but planets can export their own labor to staging hubs within trade range at a 50% reduced rate. Adds 15 Defense Reserve when in orbit around a planet. Designed to fill various support roles, notably
for use as a remote mining base, as the new balance makes tractoring ore asteroids around a pain. Build and maintenance costs of 200k and 20k, respectively.
- Added Public Market Staging Hub module. Can import influence, energy, research and defense resources and generate 5k per imported pressure as special funds every minute. Build cost of 150k.
- Added Tactical Outpost module, buildable by starports and staging hubs. Generates 1 Defense worth of local defense ships. Support ships assigned to this orbital can independently move across the system to attack enemy fleets. Support ships set to Shield, Support or Artillery behavior will not leave the orbital. Build and maintenance costs of 100k and 30k, respectively.
- Added Additional Armor Layer module, buildable by outposts and staging hubs. Adds 4000 armor and 2.5 damage resistance. Build and maintenance costs of 100k and 2.5k, respectively.
- Added Missile Rack module, buildable by outposts and staging hubs. Can fire missiles at hostile ships for 12 damage each. The number of available weapons increases with research and time. Build and maintenance cost of 50k and 15k, respectively.
- Added Starbase, which has the same functions as an outpost, but with twice as many support capacity and ship spawn speed. Also has much better armor and is armed with lasers. Only one outpost or starbase can be constructed per system. Build and maintenance cost of 750k and 100k, respectively. Cannot be built by Evangelical and Pacifist lifestyle.
- Added Additional Armor Layer module, buildable by starbases. Adds 8000 armor and 5 damage resistance. Build and maintenance costs of 200k and 5k, respectively.
- Added Large Missile Rack module, buildable by starbases. Can fire missiles at hostile ships for 25 damage each. The number of available weapons increases with research and time. Build and maintenance cost of 80k and 25k, respectively.
- Added Tactical Suite module, buildable by outposts and starbases. Support ships assigned to this orbital can independently move across the system to attack enemy fleets. Support ships set to Shield, Support or Artillery behavior will not leave the orbital. Build and maintenance costs of 100k and 30k, respectively.
- Added Listening Post module, buildable by outposts and starbases. Grants a free Intelligence influence card against a random empire in the same system or an adjacent one every minute. Build cost of 150k. Also costs 5 Influence to build.
- Added Zero-G Lab. Gives 1 Research generation and allows access to special modules and projects. Build and maintenance costs of 400k and 100k, respectively.

- Added Ring Habitat, exclusive to Star Children: replacement for Arcology. Must be constructed in orbit of a planet. Increases the maximum population of that planet by 5. Costs 5 population from the Mothership in addition to its build cost. Up to three ring habitats may be constructed in orbit of every planet. Costs 2.5M, 2k Ore, 20 Influence, and 75 Labor.
- Outposts can now be upgraded to starbases for the same cost and labor as building a starbase from scratch. Labor can now be exported to outposts.
- FTL Storage orbitals for Star Children with Flux FTL now generate 0.5 FTL Energy per second and store 600 FTL Energy to make up for the impossibility to build FTL Breeders. They also additionally cost 500 ore to build.
- All orbitals now have a base sensor range of 10.000 units which can be upgraded through research.
- Outpost health and armor have been increased, respectively, to 10000 (up from 6000) and 5000 (up from 4000).

- Ring habitat health and armor have been decreased, respectively, to 10000 (down from 20000) and 5000 (down from 10000).

[*] Planets

- Added gas giants, using previously unused vanilla low resolution textures. Gas giants can be colonized (more or less) and feature a new scalable resource designed to balance the increased scale of the game by providing increased propulsion speed and various pressure boosts. They are commonly found in all kinds of
systems, but they are more difficult to level up due to their mostly useless biome: imperial buildings cannot be built on it and civilian tile development is extremely slow. They however typically have a large number of moons where bases can be constructed. Gas giants completely bypass resource scarcity and planet
frequency options on purpose.
- Added ice giants. As gas giants, their biome is useless but they also have a large number of moons, although slightly less than gas giants. Ice giants always have a basic non exportable water resource and additionally have one of the following resources: Water (common), Pekelm (uncommon) and Salts (uncommon). Water from ice giants gives 1 Influence pressure. Ice giants also bypass resource scarcity and planet frequency options.
- Destroyed planets now yield more asteroid with less ore.
- Planets now have a base sensor range of 20.000 units which can be upgraded through research.
- Slightly reduced pressure capacity of planets per level.
- Reduced population growth by approximately 20%.
- Added a new Project exclusive to planets, Planet Exploration. Sends an exploration team around the planet. May yield a random discovery. This feature is similar to how anomalies work, with smaller bonuses, but available a (limited) number of times per planet. Homeworlds have a special set of (more beneficial) anomalies.
- Fixed a vanilla bug with asteroid fields orbiting Local Asteroid Field Planets not being rendered in certain circumstances.
- Local Asteroid Field planets now have more and bigger asteroids orbiting closer to them (this is a purely cosmetic change).
- Removed starting Labor, income and pressure cap bonuses from the homeworld.

[*] Research

- Orbital Command and Orbital Command 2 now also grant additional support capacity to starbases, starports and staging hubs and additional health to starbases.
- Laboratories now also grants 2 additional Research generation to zero-G labs.
- Added Scanning and Scanning 2 nodes. Increases all sensor ranges by 10% and 20%, respectively.
- Added the Dedicated Hauling Architecture node. Unlocks the Hauler Hull subsystem for use on flagships.
- Added the Phasing Sensors node. Unlocks the Phasing Sensors subsystem for use on flagships and stations.
- Added the Tachyon Sensors node. Unlocks the Tachyon Uplink Facility orbital. Unlocks the Tachyon Sensors subsystem for use on flagships and stations with an active Tachyon Uplink.

[*] Resources

- Welfare option base threshold is now 200k (down from 350k).
- Guaranteed resources on planets in systems adjacent to starting systems can now spawn farther in the neighborhood to counterbalance the addition of nebulae and planetless systems, which can deadlock the distribution.
- Added FTL Crystals asteroids: provide 1 FTL/s and add 250 FTL storage. These are not consumed when mined (but they can be captured...). Spawn frequency is slightly lower than FTL shards.
- FTL Shards asteroids now permanently add 500 FTL storage (up from 100).
- FTL Crystals planets now provide 0.5/1/1.5/2/3/5/10 FTL/s.
- Added Rare Gases, a new scalable resource found on gas giants only. Increases all ship engine thrust (including colony ships) by a cumulative bonus of 0%/5%/10%/30%/60%/120%/200%. Does not increase turn rate nor hyperdrive speed. Gains 1 Energy pressure per level starting from level 1, 1 Defense pressure per level starting from level 2, 1 Research pressure per level starting from level 3, 1 Influence pressure per level starting from level 4 and 1 Money pressure per level starting from level 5. Cannot be exported.
*** Sublight species are strongly advised to heavily invest in developing those planets!
- Available ore on asteroids has been reduced to anywhere from 50 to 1250 ore (down from 500 to 10000). Default ore asteroid chance per system has been changed to 90% (up from 45%). In addition, systems with ore asteroids are very likely to have a LOT of them.
- Moderately increased resource asteroid chance. Slightly decreased Construction Materials and Morphic Materials asteroid chance. Moderately decreased FTL Shards asteroid chance.
- Added a 5% chance for systems to have one or more asteroid belts. These have a chance to contain resource asteroids equal to 1/30th of the resource asteroid chance.
- Black holes now have a big, thick asteroid belt beyond their accretion disk.
- Increased default resource asteroid chance to 60% (up from 45%).
- Renamed Electronics resource to Semiconductors.
- Greatly reduced the number of Water resources and slightly reduced the number of Food resources on regular planets.
- Water asteroids are now much more frequent.
- Deuterium and Neutronium can now very rarely spawn as an asteroid resource.
- Comets now have a low chance of spawning in systems regardless of the artifact frequency option.
- Protoplanets now have a high chance of spawning in systems with young stars regardless of the artifact frequency option.
- Empires no longer start with any FTL generation or FTL storage regardless of FTL trait choice.
- Empires now have an additional an additional FTL Crystals asteroid in their home system. A mine is prebuilt if the Quick Start game option is toggled on. This effectively reverts the starting FTL generation and FTL storage to vanilla values.
- Empires now have an additional an additional Pekelm asteroid in their home system. A mine is prebuilt if the Quick Start game option is toggled on.
- Empires now have an additional an additional Explosives asteroid in an adjacent system.
- Empires now have an additional an additional FTL Crystals asteroid in a neighboring system.
- Empires now have an additional an additional Neutronium asteroid in a neighboring system.
- Empires now have 6k worth of ore asteroids in their home system instead of one 6k ore asteroid.
- Empires now have an additional anomaly in their home system.
- Empires now have an additional Comet in their home system.
- Empires no longer have 2 guaranteed Water planets in adjacent systems.

[*] Subsystems

- Added Hauler Hull. Increases cargo storage by 25%. Cargo storage must fill at least 50% of the ship. Reduces supply capacity by 90%. Cannot have weapons or support command.
- Miner Hull no longer provides a maintenance reduction bonus nor shield capacity bonus and its cargo storage bonus is reduced to 12.5% (down from 25%).
- Added Sensor Dish. Increases sight range by a small amount. Adding more than one dish doesn't increase sight range more and only gives redundancy benefits.
- Added Phasing Sensors. Increases sight range by a moderate amount, decreasing as the subsystem's size increases. Requires Power. Requires increasingly high amounts of Power and Control as the subsystem's size increases. Sinew halves the Control requirements.
- Ra-added and overhauled Tachyon Sensors from ABEM. Increases sight range by a high amount, decreasing as the subsystem's size increases. Requires an active Tachyon Uplink orbital to function. Requires increasingly high amounts of Control as the subsystem's size increases. Sinew halves the Control requirements.
- Added Phased Array Laser Drive. Allows station designs with the same functionalities as the orbital of the same name, with scaling.
- Added Lightsail, a reflector panel allowing to use the momentum of photons as actual thrust. Does not need fuel, very low maintenance cost. Lightsails on the outside of the ship do not use up interior space. Thrust is not improved by research. Requires to be within range of an active laser propulsion beam to function a full efficiency, or a near a star to function at low efficiency.
- Added High Impulse System, a railgun exclusive modification. Knockbacks the target on impact. Nullifies armor piercing.
- Added Neutronium Re-chambering, a railgun exclusive modification. Increases piercing by 50% and damage by 10%. Very high build cost with significant labor cost.
- Increased most weapon ranges by a factor of 2. Energy Bomb, Plasma Thrower, Pulse Bolt and Subspace Shredder ranges are unchanged. The Flak Battery range formula has been tweaked to keep a much more linear and slow progression relative to ship size.
- Increased Planetary Cannon, Planetary Defense Grid and Ancient Gravitational Collapser ranges by a factor of 4.
- Increased Fleet Computer raiding range bonus (and base raiding range) by a factor of 6.
- Superstructure Hull now provides less build and labor cost reduction, but its ore cost is drastically reduced. Maintenance cost reduction is unchanged.
- Added Laser Drive Power subsystem stat (for laser drives).
- Added Impulse subsystem stat for railguns.
- Added Points of Impact, Fallout Duration and Supply Cost subsystem stats for carpet bombs.

[*] Systems

*** The increased scale of gas sprites strongly impacts system performances when playing with lots of stars and / or nebulae. Consider turning galaxy gas off if you experience stuttering.
- Increased scale of stars by a factor of 10.
- Increased scale of planets by a factor of 10.
- Increased scale of planet gravity wells by a factor relative to its planet's 'mass'.
- Increased scale of ringworld gravity wells to their system's radius to simulate them having no gravity well (they have no core), but instead objects actually orbiting around the star. As a side effect, orbitals restricted to planet gravity well can be built anywhere in the system, which seems completely reasonable for ringworlds.
- Increased scale of asteroids by a factor of 2.
- Decreased scale of ships by a factor of 0.5.
- Increased default system spacing by a factor of around 23 (150.000 units). System spacing can no longer be reduced below the default value.
- Increased variance in vertical spacing of systems in the core of spiral galaxies.
- Increased variance in planet number per system, possibly down to 0. Systems with no planets have a greatly increased chance of hiding valuable asteroids and artifacts.
- Increased chance of binary systems.
- Stars in binary systems can now have much more spacing.
- Black holes in the core of spiral and cluster galaxies are now supermassive if the Supermassive Black Holes game option is toggled on.
*** The massive scale of the supermassive black holes accretion disks impacts system performances the higher the game speed is. Consider turning this option off if you experience stuttering.
- The guaranteed moon around the level 1 planet in the home system has moved to the homeworld.

[*] User Interface

- Reduced Ore Asteroid strategic icon size by a factor of 3 so their sheer number does not disturb strategic icon system display when zoomed out.
- Fixed a vanilla bug where the dry dock construction menu would list different versions of a design under certain circumstances.
- Fixed a vanilla bug where persistent beam effects were not restored upon loading a save file.
- Fixed an vanilla issue with strategic icon positions not always updating correctly when zooming due to the engine squaring already huge rescaled distances, resulting in a memory overflow.

[*] Other

- Fixed a vanilla bug where status stacks spent to build certain things (like troop pods filled with troops) would only ever refund one instance instead of the correct amount when refunded.

[*] Known issues

- Stations with the Phased Array Laser Drive subsystem will not show the range of their Laser Propulsion Beam ability (this is not the case with the orbital of the same name). This is a technical limitation that will be addressed in a future release.
- Modules available to build on orbitals build instantly. It is unknown if this is an originally intended behavior but there is no vanilla code to handle construction queues. This may or may not be changed in a future release.
